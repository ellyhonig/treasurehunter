<h1> MISSION BRIEFING</h1>
<h2> You shouldn't be alive. You survived the fallout of the Philippino Guerrilla uprising. According to all international databases, you dont exist. Now you're a rouge mercenary looking for work wherever you can find it. Deep in the forests of Peru you're offered a mission: collect 500 ancient coins made from a rare isotope of gold located deep within an ancient tunnel network. Good luck soldier. </h2>
